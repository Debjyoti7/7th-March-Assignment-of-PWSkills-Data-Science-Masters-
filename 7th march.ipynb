By calculating the variance or standard deviation, we can get a more precise measure of the spread of the data. The variance of this dataset is 50, and the standard deviation is approximately 7.07. This indicates that the scores are somewhat spread out, with some variability around the mean. Using these measures of dispersion, we can get a more complete picture of the distribution of exam scores and make more informed decisions based on the data."
